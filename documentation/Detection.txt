Name:		Large Class
Location:	Validator class, between lines 42-94 and 106-151
Reasons:	Class was wearing too many hats
Strategy:	Extract data cleaning methods and data validation methods, move to new static classes.

Name:		Introduce Parameter Object
Location:	Editor class, lines 82-84 - Editor.set_new_value()
Reasons:	Editor.validate() overly relied on this generic method, difficult to test, overly complicated
Strategy:	Create a new immutable class to represent the different options to be passed to the method

Name:		Consolidate Conditional Expression
Location:	Editor class, lines 38-58 - Editor.validate()
Reasons:	Long if statement, overly complex for what was needed
Strategy:	Consolidate the conditionals in a single expression, a more pythonic solution
